# Kaggle-Challenge-Marathon
I will be doing a Kaggle ML challanges marathon where I will complete one challange every week

For the first week I am doing the famous [Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset
My kaggle kernel can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/itslisu/eda-and-survived-prediction?scriptVersionId=51259435) and the jupyter notebook with explanation can be found [here](https://github.com/pritesh-ranjan/Kaggle-Challenge-Marathon/blob/main/WEEK_1/eda-and-survived-prediction.ipynb).
This is my first try, please let me know if there is something that needs to be changed.
