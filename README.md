# Kaggle-Challenge-Marathon
I will be doing a Kaggle ML challanges marathon where I will complete one challange every week

For the first week I am doing the famous [Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset
My kaggle kernel can be found [here]() and the jupyter notebook with explanation can be found [here]().
This is my first try, please let me know if there is something that needs to be changed.
